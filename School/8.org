* Attendance

- For the first week, we will take attendance daily so we get used to the routine.
- During attendance, within a few seconds of saying your name you should reply with audio 'here'.
- If your internet connection a particular day is not working during attendance, to get credit you will need to send me an email.
- After that we will do it once or twice a week.
- Attendance will be 20% of your classwork grade.
- Attendance will typically occur at a random time during class (between 0 and 37 mins into class)
