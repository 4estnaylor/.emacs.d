**** DONE Do at least 30 pull ups
*** notes

Today went well, I read GTD some more, and that gave me some more motivation to be productive and organized. Obviously it's been a bit of a rocky road since I started Jan 1 more or less, but I think it's a good sign 
i've been able to stick with things this far more or less. I'm still experimenting with how I organize myself. But, I think the initial time investment is starting to become worth it. I think this could be a really productive system for me. 

I went to Veronica's interview on a local Christian TV station. It was ano hour long, and she did an amazing job, playing 4 of her songs and discussing what her trajectory as a Honduran artist has been like.

Today was a pretty good day. I find that I am still pretty easily distracted at times, but I am getting much more organized. More meditation may help increase my ability to focus. I'm beginning to feel the effects of regularly practicing with emacs. It is becoming an incredibly powerful tool, while still admittedly taking much of my time.
Today I did a yoga practice with Vero about feeling 'loving compassion' as a a way to be less critical of our self and others, I think it is a good practice that maybe I can start practicing daily. 

On one hand, I feel myself getting older as a 27 and a half year old, on the other hand I feel like I am making good use of time. One major source of stress is finances. Fortunately, I don't have any very immediate concerns because I was born into my family, but I am disattisfied with 
(1) the nagging feeling that I am a net drag on myself, my family, and society. It is a genearl feeling of decay, disturbing in a way captured well by the story: the fall of the House of Usher.
(2) the thoughts that if I one day have a family/children, I will not be able them opportunites similar to those that I was graced with.

** Notes
Today I was very productive and managed to avoid looking at Reddit. Definitely helped to get the application off of my phone. 

Vero had a tough day because her parents were complaining that she might not be doing enough to keep our relationship healthy: between traveling, and being less than active at times.

I feel a little off too. I regularly think about Jenn. I still remember bad times too though. I just feel not at ease, and uncomfortable often when I am in town.

I feel, ... 
strange with Vero sometimes. She is amazing, but I worry that things aren't perfect. I worry that maybe I am not meant to be with any one person....
Maybe I have just somehow become incompatible with living and sharing all of my life's most intimate moments with a single other person. 
Maybe I am just spoiled, and suffering from grass is green syndrome.

I think things are going pretty well with my GTD system. I want to dedicate tomorrow to spending some serious time making an animation in Krita.
It could be interesting...

But! I also have my interactive stair growth pattern program to finish...
