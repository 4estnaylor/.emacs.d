**** DONE Do at least 30 pull ups
*** notes

Today went well, I read GTD some more, and that gave me some more motivation to be productive and organized. Obviously it's been a bit of a rocky road since I started Jan 1 more or less, but I think it's a good sign 
i've been able to stick with things this far more or less. I'm still experimenting with how I organize myself. But, I think the initial time investment is starting to become worth it. I think this could be a really productive system for me. 

I went to Veronica's interview on a local Christian TV station. It was ano hour long, and she did an amazing job, playing 4 of her songs and discussing what her trajectory as a Honduran artist has been like.

Today was a pretty good day. I find that I am still pretty easily distracted at times, but I am getting much more organized. More meditation may help increase my ability to focus. I'm beginning to feel the effects of regularly practicing with emacs. It is becoming an incredibly powerful tool, while still admittedly taking much of my time.
Today I did a yoga practice with Vero about feeling 'loving compassion' as a a way to be less critical of our self and others, I think it is a good practice that maybe I can start practicing daily. 

On one hand, I feel myself getting older as a 27 and a half year old, on the other hand I feel like I am making good use of time. One major source of stress is finances. Fortunately, I don't have any very immediate concerns because I was born into my family, but I am disattisfied with 
(1) the nagging feeling that I am a net drag on myself, my family, and society. It is a genearl feeling of decay, disturbing in a way captured well by the story: the fall of the House of Usher.
(2) the thoughts that if I one day have a family/children, I will not be able them opportunites similar to those that I was graced with

*** Notes
 Today I was very productive and managed to avoid looking at Reddit. Definitely helped to get the application off of my phone. 

 Vero had a tough day because her parents were complaining that she might not be doing enough to keep our relationship healthy: between traveling, and being less than active at times.

 I feel a little off too. I regularly think about Jenn. I still remember bad times too though. I just feel not at ease, and uncomfortable often when I am in town.

 I feel, ... 
 strange with Vero sometimes. She is amazing, but I worry that things aren't perfect. I worry that maybe I am not meant to be with any one person....
 Maybe I have just somehow become incompatible with living and sharing all of my life's most intimate moments with a single other person. 
 Maybe I am just spoiled, and suffering from grass is green syndrome.

 I think things are going pretty well with my GTD system. I want to dedicate tomorrow to spending some serious time making an animation in Krita.
 It could be interesting...

 But! I also have my interactive stair growth pattern program to finish...

*** Goals [3/3]
**** DONE Read about animation
**** DONE Draw something in Krita
**** DONE Finish Casa en Mango Street
*** Notes
 The power went out today, so I am giving myself a bit of an excuse for some missed habits/chores.

 I want to hit the ground running tomorrow with activity, but it is a rest day for exercise, maybe I will go for a morning run instead. Vero and I visited Ben and Maria. Maria was pretty hypocritical acting smitten with Ben one moment, and then complaining that she didn't want to have him around anymore when he got up to go to the bathroom...

 It may be that Maria's pride was hurt and that she wants to show others (us), that she has not forgiven Ben for cheating on her.

**** DONE Do weekly review well 
**** DONE Read at least 20% in Meditations
**** DONE Tune up recommendation letters
*** Notes

** weekly review refelection Feb 1 to Feb 7

Did I achieve my weekly goals? Yes

-> Finish la Casa en Mango Street -> A fairly short book but I definitely improved my vocabulary in Spanish by taking careful notes for much of it.
-> Go on three walks with Vero -> Vero made this easy, we went on 3 walks/runs and will likely go on a 4th today
-> Submit Application to McDonogh -> This was basically finished for me already, but yes I sent the letter of interst and my resume


Strengths:
I never had a totally unproductive day, there was always something I could and was tempted to knock off of my list.
I got certain things done that I often don't -> i.e. change the lightbulb in the bathroom, read a book, 6 days of yoga, 30 pull ups every day.

Habits seem to be my strongest category, perhaps because of the idea of getting blue astriks rather than red empty spaces.

I like how I can see my daily goals at the top and my weekly goals at the bottom, it keeps me on task, but makes sure I also have an eye towards what I want to accomplish this week.


Weaknesses:

When Vero is gone, I often waste time
-> Reddit
-> Masturbating
-> Staring blankly into space

First and foremost Projects, I did not get an insane amount of project work done. It is very easy for me to scan for a habit, chore, or one off next task to dig into first.

I could do two things to help with projects:
(1) make efforts to make the tasks more atomic, it will make it easier to start
(2) require a project task in each daily goal
(3) be okay with not making progress in every single project, but be insistent on making good progress for at least one project a week.

I am not adding tasks nearly as quickly as I am completing them. This may be because I am putting off project tasks.

Other Ideas:

I am a little world my daily view is getting a little cluttered, that my monthly goals are too invisible, that I don't have a contingency for travel days when I cannot get many of my habits done, it seems a little unfair that all my streaks have to die.... Maybe I could 




This week I found the GTD system definitely useful for keeping me from unproductive spirals. 
Two things the stuck out were my habit for slowly getting out of bed rather than immediately waking up with my alarm.
And also obsessively checking reddit and other social media in a totally unproductive way. (I got rid of the reddit icon, but not that app on my phone).
