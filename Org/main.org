 send resume, breif summary of Cindy Knipp's introduction.

Hello Mary Catherine, I am Forrest Naylor. I am a math teacher who has spent the last 4 years teaching math classes mostly in grades 8 to 12 at schools in Nicaragua and Honduras. Cindy Knipp is a close family friend and recommended that I get in touch with you because of your focus on global learning and connection to McDonogh school which is only a few minutes drive from my childhood home.

Cindy also knows that I am likely planning on returning to live in Baltimore at some point over the next year and recommended I attach my resume to this email in case at some point down the road you know of or hear of a teaching position that I may be suitable for.   

Maybe we could follow up via phone or video call at some point if you have the time and energy available! In any case, I would really love to hear about your experience working with students from other countries in your own classroom.

All the best,

Forrest Naylor
