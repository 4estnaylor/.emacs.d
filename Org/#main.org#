 send resume, breif summary of Cindy Knipp's introduction.

Hello Mary Catherine, I am Forrest Naylor. I am a math teacher who has spent the last 4 years teaching math classes mostly in grades 8 to 12 at schools in Nicaragua and Honduras. Cindy Knipp is a close family friend and recommended that I get in touch with you because of your focus on global learning and connection to McDonogh school which is only a few minutes drive from my childhood home.

Cindy also knows that I am likely planning on returning to live in Baltimore at some point over the next year and recommended I attach my resume to this email in case at some point down the road you know of or hear of a teaching position that I may be suitable for.   

Maybe we could follow up via phone or video call at some point if you have the time and energy available! In any case, I would really love to hear about your experience working with students from other countries in your own classroom.

All the best,

Forrest Naylor


Part 2 

   Thank you for the email.  What a cool few years you have had!  I am so jealous of your experiences and am more than happy to help you as you navigate a move back to the US.  In your dream world, what age would you work with? Do you want to continue with coaching?  Co-ed or single-sex? Would you be willing to do a fellowship for a year or two?  I know that McD and Gilman both have very strong internship programs for new teachers and it is a great way to get established in a school as a young teacher. At McD, they provide you with housing. So, tell me what you really want and I would love to help you. As you know, Baltimore is such a small town and having connections is amazingly important. I know quite a few people at different schools and I would love to help you get settled.

In my dream world I would . I would love to be a part of coaching in some way if possible. I think a fellowship or an internship would be ideal for me. However, I am not sure to what extent age is a criteria and I am 27 years old.
